React Best Practices 

Compound Components -

-> Compound components are the react components that do not work stand alone but only multiple component come and work together.

-> Multiple component that do not work stand alone but together. For example <select> and <option> html elements works together. And not alone.And thus we can call them compound elements.

->  We create the Accordion component which acts as an wrapper for all the accordion items.
